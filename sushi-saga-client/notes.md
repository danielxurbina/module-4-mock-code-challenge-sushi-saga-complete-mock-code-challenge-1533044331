Inspectors will be coming by to check that our patented Sushi Saga conveyor belt is working properly! Oh no! They will be checking the following:

<!-- 1. Sushi is properly received from the server -->

<!-- 2. Only 4 sushi are rendered at a time -->

<!-- 3. Clicking the "More Sushi!" button produces a new set of 4 sushi -->

4. Clicking a sushi on a plate will eat the sushi, causing it to be removed from its plate and an empty plate to appear on the table.

<!-- 5. We need to make money! Whenever a sushi is eaten, customers should be automatically charged! Based on a budget decided by you, the developer, the amount of money remaining should go down by the cost of the sushi that was eaten. There is a spot to display this number in the Table component -->
<!--
6. No free meals! Customers cannot eat any sushi that exceeds the amount of money remaining in their balance -->
